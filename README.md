# flight-exercise-notebook

This project contains a single asset which is an import file for DSE Studio that guides a candidate through the Flight Exercise.

To use, simply download the tar file, launch your DSE 6 Studio environment, use the "Import" command in Studio, and select the tar file.  

**Note:  You not need to expand the tar file.  Studio expects a tar file for import
